# Secure and Scalable ATM Management System ‚Äì Spring Boot
This project is a secure and scalable ATM management system developed with Spring Boot. 
It ensures that only users from registered banks can access ATM services, enhancing security and limiting access to authorized customers.

## Key Features:
## User Registration & Authentication:

* Users must select one of the pre-registered banks during the registration process. This ensures that only customers of supported banks can use the ATM.
* After successful registration, users are redirected to the login page.
* Users have three attempts to enter their password correctly. If they fail three times, their account is locked for security reasons.

## Banking Transactions:
*  Successfully authenticated users can perform the following operations:
   * Deposit Money
   * Withdraw Money
   * Transfer Money to other accounts

* Every transaction is logged and recorded for security and auditing purposes.

## Admin Panel:

* Admins have special privileges to:
  * View each user‚Äôs transaction history.
  * Access the complete transaction history of all users.
  * Register new banks to the ATM system.
  * List all registered banks.
  * View user balances by bank name and access all users‚Äô banking details.

## User Experience & Error Handling:

* The project is primarily developed with Thymeleaf, providing an intuitive and dynamic web interface.
* Detailed error messages are thrown for incorrect actions, allowing users to understand exactly where they made a mistake.

This project leverages Spring Security for authentication, Thymeleaf for frontend rendering, and robust logging mechanisms to track all transactions, ensuring a secure and efficient ATM system.

# NOTES
### AdminInitializer
This class automatically creates an admin user with the username `admin` and password `admin` at the beginning of the program

### IBAN Generator:
* IBAN (International Bank Account Number) is used in banking systems to identify a unique bank account. This class automatically generates a user-specific IBAN number.
* The IBAN number is formatted according to the requirements of a specific country and bank.
* You can use the `IbanGenerator` class to generate a random IBAN number.

### SWIFT Kodu Generator:
* SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) code is a unique code used for international banking transactions.
* This class automatically generates the correct SWIFT code based on the bank name and country code.
* You can use the `SwiftCodeGenerator` class to generate a random SWIFT code.
